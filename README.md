# Random Wallpaper Setter

This repository contains resources for setting random wallpapers on your Windows system using a PowerShell script.
I may later help expand this for Linux systems too.

## Folder Structure

- **Desktop/**  
  Contains wallpapers intended for use as Desktop backgrounds.

- **LockScreen/**  
  Contains wallpapers intended for use as Lock Screen backgrounds.

## PowerShell Script

- **Set-RandomWallpapers.ps1**  
  A PowerShell script that sets random wallpapers for both the Desktop and Lock Screen. It selects images randomly from the respective folders (`Desktop` and `LockScreen`).

### Usage

You can run the script manually or schedule it to run at specific intervals using Task Scheduler.
